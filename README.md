## This plugin adds the following commands:
/do — to do something,\
/try — to try something,\
/coin — to toss a coin,\
/whisper — to whisper something,\
**NEW** /dice — to toss a dice.

## There is a /me command in Vanilla Minecraft, and _rpchat_ splits it in 2 commands:
/gme (global me) — say something in the third person (all players will see the message),\
/me (local me) — say something in the third person (the message will be seen only by those players who're close to you).
